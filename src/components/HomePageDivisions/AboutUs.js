                        Alan Thomas is a second-year student pursuing his Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with specialization at the esteemed Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore campus. I am interested in Machine Learning and have a few projects on the same. I have an interest in other fields of technology as well as closely follow the sport of Formula1.
